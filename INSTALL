Installation only makes sense to follow the development. Anything might
change. Don't expect support for versions other than the current. 

The installation of Package::Transporter requires mro, which is part
of the core modules since Perl 5.10. It is even available for 5.8 and
before. There is a compatibility module called MRO::Compat, which
provides the mro:: package namespace and subroutines, but surprisingly
you can't simply load it with 'use mro'.  Thus the CPAN shell won't
automatically install MRO::Compat for you.

After installing MRO::Compat manually, you might want to install the
following three lines in a file like
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/$PERL_VERSION/mro.pm to fix the issue:

	package mro;
	use MRO::Compat;
	1;


Other than that, Package::Transporter is fairly straightforward in terms of
installation. 

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Package::Transporter makes use of the follwoing modules, most
of which are part of the Perl5 core.

	Scalar::Util
	mro
	parent
	Carp
	Test::Simple (for installation)

The example files and some generators require these additional modules:

	Data::Dumper
	Fcntl
	SDBM_File
	DBI (not in the core, but widely found)
