Object::Episode - manage series of asynchronous events

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there
are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general
production use, yet.

Object::Episode provides a rather minimalistic OO interface to
asynchronous events. Delivery is done via method calls only, which
implies a double linking between objects. The double linkage is extra
effort, but once done, event programming is easy.
